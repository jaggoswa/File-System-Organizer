# File-System-Organizer

In this project, I created a CLI tool to organize files in a folder which are not properly arranged, for easy access.

The following commands are implemented: <br/><br/>
help - To check the format for using different commands. <br/>
organize - To organize files into different directories according to their extensions. <br/>
tree - To view the listing of directories and files recursively inside a directory.
